""" Fine-tuning a ðŸ¤— Transformers CTC model for automatic speech recognition"""

"""
Nhan documentation on the finetune script

The model might be different with other Finnish wav2vec2 model due to the following:

There's no <s> and </s> in the vocab.json, but they're in the special_tokens_map.json

There's difference when you call:
# Load vocab file (no added token)
with open(path_model + '/vocab.json', encoding='utf-8') as json_file:
    vocab = json.load(json_file)
    
or using (have added tokens):
vocab_dict = processor.tokenizer.get_vocab()  

This would cause some small problem when the logits matrix didn't output the added token in prediction
(since we never added <s> and </s> to the model)
For the purpose of mispronunciation problem, this won't cause any trouble

Newer version of the model was fixed when I did a new finetune, but nevertheless the old version has this problem
